      "Thank you. Thank you, everybody. How do you like my new entrance music? Rush Limbaugh warned you about this second term, baby. Were changing things around here a little bit. Actually, my advisors were a little worried about the new rap entrance music. They are a little more traditional. They suggested that I should start with some jokes at my own expense, just take myself down a peg. I was like, guys, after four and a half years, how many pegs are there left? I want to thank the White House Correspondents. Ed, youre doing an outstanding job. We are grateful for the great work youve done. To all the dignitaries who are here, everybody on the dais I especially want to say thank you to General Ray Odierno, who does outstanding service on behalf of our country, and all our men and women in uniform every single day. And of course, our extraordinary First Lady, Michelle Obama. Everybody loves Michelle. Shes on the cover of Vogue, high poll numbers. But dont worry I recently got my own magazine cover. Now, look, I get it. These days, I look in the mirror and I have to admit, Im not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be. Time passes. You get a little gray. And yet, even after all this time, I still make rookie mistakes. Like, Im out in California, were at a fundraiser were having a nice time. I happen to mention that Kamala Harris is the best- looking attorney general in the country. As you might imagine, I got trouble when I got back home. Who knew Eric Holder was so sensitive? And then theres the Easter Egg Roll, which is supposed to be just a nice, fun event with the kids. I go out on the basketball court, took 22 shots made two of them. Thats right two hits, 20 misses. The executives at NBC asked, Whats your secret? So, yes, maybe I have lost a step. But some things are beyond my control. For example, this whole controversy about Jaz-Z going to Cuba its unbelievable. Ive got 99 problems and now Jay-Z is one. Thats another rap reference, Bill. Ill let you know. Of course, everybody has got plenty of advice. Maureen Dowd said I could solve all my problems if I were just more like Michael Douglas in The American President. And I know Michael is here tonight. Michael, whats your secret, man? Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy? Might that have something to do with it? I dont know. Check in with me. Maybe its something else. Anyway, I recognize that this job can take a toll on you. I understand second term, you need a burst of new energy, try some new things. And my team and I talked about it. We were willing to try anything. So we borrowed one of Michelles tricks. I thought this looked pretty good, but no bounce. I want to give a shout-out to our headliner, Conan OBrien. I was just talking to Ed, and I understand that when the Correspondents Association was considering Conan for this gig, they were faced with that age-old dilemma Do you offer it to him now, or wait for five years and then give it to Jimmy Fallon? That was a little harsh. I love Conan. And of course, the White House press corps is here. I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate. Some of my former advisors have switched over to the dark side. For example, David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod. The History Channel is not here. I guess they were embarrassed about the whole Obama-is-a- devil thing. Of course, that never kept Fox News from showing up. They actually thought the comparison was not fair to Satan. But the problem is, is that the media landscape is changing so rapidly. You cant keep up with it. I mean, I remember when BuzzFeed was just something I did in college around 200 a.m. Its true. Recently, though, I found a new favorite source for political news these guys are great. I think everybody here should check it out, they tell it like it is. Its called WhiteHouse.gov. I cannot get enough of it. The fact is I really do respect the press. I recognize that the press and I have different jobs to do. My job is to be President your job is to keep me humble. Frankly, I think Im doing my job better. But part of the problem is everybody is so cynical. I mean, were constantly feeding cynicism, suspicion, conspiracies. You remember a few months ago, my Administration put out a photograph of me going skeet shooting at Camp David? You remember that? And quite a number of people insisted that this had been photoshopped. But tonight I have something to confess You were right. Guys, can we show them the actual photo? We were just trying to tone it down a little bit. That was an awesome day. There are other new players in the media landscape as well, like super PACs. Did you know that Sheldon Adelson spent 100 million dollars of his own money last year on negative ads? Youve got to really dislike me to spend that kind of money. I mean, thats Oprah money. You could buy an island and call it Nobama for that kind of money. Sheldon would have been better off offering me 100 million dollar to drop out of the race. I probably wouldnt have taken it, but I'd have thought about it. Michelle would have taken it. You think Im joking? I know Republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012, but one thing they all agree on is they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with. Hello? Think of me as a trial run, you know? See how it goes. If they wont come to me, I will come to them. Recently, I had dinner its been well publicized I had dinner with a number of the Republican senators. And Ill admit it wasnt easy. I proposed a toast it died in committee. Of course, even after I've done all this, some folks still dont think I spend enough time with Congress. Why dont you get a drink with Mitch McConnell? they ask. Really? Why dont you get a drink with Mitch McConnell? I'm sorry. I get frustrated sometimes. I am not giving up. In fact, I'm taking my charm offensive on the road a Texas barbeque with Ted Cruz, a Kentucky bluegrass concert with Rand Paul, and a book-burning with Michele Bachmann. My charm offensive has helped me learn some interesting things about what's going on in Congress it turns out, absolutely nothing. But the point of my charm offensive is simple We need to make progress on some important issues. Take the sequester. Republicans fell in love with this thing, and now they can't stop talking about how much they hate it. It's like we're trapped in a Taylor Swift album. One senator who has reached across the aisle recently is Marco Rubio, but I dont know about 2016. I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be President. Kids these days. I, on the other hand, have run my last campaign. On Thursday, as Ed mentioned, I went to the opening of the Bush Presidential Library in Dallas. It was a wonderful event, and that inspired me to get started on my own legacy, which will actually begin by building another edifice right next to the Bush Library can we show that, please? I'm also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library. And some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I'd rather keep it in the United States. Did anybody not see that joke coming? Show of hands. Only Gallup? Maybe Dick Morris? Now, speaking of presidents and their legacies, I want to acknowledge a wonderful friend, Steven Spielberg, and Daniel Day-Lewis, who are here tonight. We had a screening of their most recent film, Lincoln, which was an extraordinary film. I am a little nervous, though, about Steven's next project. I saw a behind-the-scenes look on HBO well, let's just check it out. Roll the tape. tape rolls It's a remarkable transformation. Do I really sound like that, though, honey? Groucho Marx once said and, Senator Cruz, thats Groucho Marx, not Karl. Thats the other guy. Groucho Marx once told an audience, Before I speak, I have something important to say. And along those same lines, I want to close on a more serious note. Obviously, there has been no shortage of news to cover over these past few weeks.
